# Performance Comparison of Probabilistic and Deterministic Data Structures

In the field of computer science, the choice of data structures plays a pivotal role in organizing and managing data efficiently. Imagine the difference between searching for a book in a library where books are randomly scattered versus one where they are meticulously organizedâ€”the impact on retrieval time is profound. 

This project delves into the realm of data structures, focusing on Treaps, Skip Lists, AVL Trees, and Red-Black Trees. These structures are designed to streamline operations such as insertion, deletion, and search within datasets. Each structure adheres to specific rules governing its organization, ensuring data remains orderly amidst changes.

## Probabilistic vs. Deterministic Approaches

Treaps and Skip Lists adopt a probabilistic approach, leveraging randomness to maintain balance and expedite operations. Conversely, deterministic self-balancing trees like AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees strictly adhere to predefined rules to sustain balance and operational efficiency.

## Project Objectives

This research endeavors to compare the performance of probabilistic structures (Treaps and Skip Lists) against deterministic self-balancing trees (AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees) concerning insertion, deletion, and search operations. Additionally, the study aims to assess the balance maintained by Treaps and Skip Lists in comparison to their deterministic counterparts. 

Through comprehensive analysis and experimentation, this paper aims to furnish a lucid comparison of these diverse data structures.
